# Ruby Coding Challenge - i18n backend

## Build
As an experienced Rails developer youâ€˜re most certainly familiar with the i18n gem [1], the most popular choice to internationalise Ruby applications. The i18n gem supports multiple backends to store and retrieve translations.

Your challenge: Remote file support for the i18n gem
  - Create a Ruby gem that builds on top of the i18n library
  - This new library should support fetching translation files via HTTP rather than just relying on local translation files
  - It should be possible to fall back to local translation files in case of any network issues

## Installation

  - Clone this repository to your local machine
  - Switch to Gem's project folder, install required dependencies with `bundle` and build a gem with `rake build`
  - Switch to your project, where you would like to add this Gem
  - Add `gem 'phrase', path: '<your_local_path>/phrase/'` to your Gemfile and run `bundle`
  - Now you can configure your I18n translation backend to use this HttpTranslations extension by adding the following code to your configuration file (in case of Rails: `application.rb`):
    - set remote repository endpoint, where locales are stored and should be accessed: `I18n::Backend::HttpTranslations.endpoint = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leapcode/leap_web/master/config/locales/'`
    - configure fallback to local locales: `I18n.backend = I18n::Backend::Chain.new(I18n::Backend::HttpTranslations.new, I18n::Backend::Simple.new)`
    - While using fallback don't forget to load the local locale files as well:
      `I18n.load_path = Dir[File.join(<locales_dir>, '*.yml')]`
  - By using `I18n.translate(...)` the remote locale will be parsed and the corresponding translation will be used.
  - The remote endpoint is supposed to provide a corresponding YAML file for each configured locale (f.e. en.yml for `:en`)

## Usage

  - If the provided base path for the remote translation files is available, the translations will be loaded from there
  - Otherwise there is a fallback to use the locally present files

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
